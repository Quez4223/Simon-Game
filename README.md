Simon Says Browser Game
Code Languages:
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript
JQuery
Simon Game Theme:
Mardi Gras color scheme 
Things I want to improve on this game later: make game pad look more like simon game, make buttons flash better, make game more functional with scoreboard and better css 
Current game function: Game makes randomization or the array. When clicked console logs success or game over. Need to make buttons light or flash when clicked and have proper sound when clicked. 
Game has all functionality but does not work the exact way it should. Game has sound, buttons light up when hovered over and plays sound when clicked. Game does not play without DOM open. I want to fix this in the future and to add a score counter.
