Simon Says Browser Game
Code Languages:
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript
JQuery
Simon Game Theme:
Mardi Gras color scheme 
Things I want to improve on this game later: make game pad look more like simon game, make buttons flash better, make game more functional with scoreboard and better css 
Current game function: Game makes randomization or the array. When clicked console logs success or game over. Need to make buttons light or flash when clicked and have proper sound when clicked.
